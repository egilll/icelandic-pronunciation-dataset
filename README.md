A dataset containing 3 million Icelandic words transcribed in the standardized Icelandic version of the International Phonetic Alphabet. It is based on the [Hjal project](http://www.malfong.is/index.php?pg=hjal&lang=en)'s [Pronunciation Dictionary](http://malfong.is/?pg=framburdur&lang=en) and on word lists from [BÍN](https://bin.arnastofnun.is/DMII/LTData/).

## Search engine

##About

The data is generated by finding patterns in the [Pronunciation Dictionary for Icelandic](http://malfong.is/?pg=framburdur&lang=en) by the [Hjal project](http://www.malfong.is/index.php?pg=hjal&lang=en) & Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson (released under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)).

Several changes were made to the original dataset:

* Regional variants were removed
* The less common heterophone ("halli" vs. "Halli") is not included
* Various errors fixed

That dataset may be found in the file [patterns.csv](setup/patterns.csv) and is available under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

The word list is derived from the *[Database of Modern Icelandic Inflection](https://bin.arnastofnun.is/DMII/LTData/)* (DMII or BÍN) by the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies. The author and editor of DMII is [Kristín Bjarnadóttir](https://www.arnastofnun.is/is/stofnunin/starfsfolk/kristin-bjarnadottir). <small>([CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/))</small>
